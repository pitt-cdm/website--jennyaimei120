									<p>My first trip around the world was when I was 9 months old. I was adopted from China, and brought to the U.S. at a very young age. I've always done some traveling since many of my family members live in different states. I love seeing new places, and although I haven't been to many outside of the U.S., I would love to see the rest of the world. My one major trip was over this summer to Europe. My one aunt provides a trip to each of the nieces or nephews to go wherever they want. I've always wanted to go to London and Paris, so thats where I chose to go. It was by far my favorite trip. I got to experience and learn so many different things. In the future, I would really like to go to Italy, The Netherlands, Australia, and Greece.  </p>
